	 * client according to the other options defined on this class.
	 * If it's false, calling reload on a dirty record will throw an
	 * error, and any side loaded data from the server will be discarded.
	 *
	 * Note: If this is turned off, no relationship can be reloaded if
	 * either of the records is dirty. So if the server says that
	 * record 1 is connected to record 2, and you reload record 1, which
	 * is clean, Ember-Graph will abort the reload if record 2 is dirty.
	 * This is a particularly annoying corner case that can be mostly
	 * avoided in two ways: either enable reloadDirty, or ensure that
	 * records are changed and then saved or rollback back in the same
	 * 'action'. (Don't let users perform different modifications at
	 * the same time.)

	 * any temporary client side relationships on reload.
